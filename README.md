Cybersecurity Internship Tasks - Prodigy-Infotech

This repository documents the cybersecurity tasks and projects I undertook during my internship at Prodigy-Infotech. The internship offered me valuable hands-on experience in tackling real-world security challenges faced by enterprises, helping me to develop and apply my technical skills in cybersecurity.

Purpose:

The tasks in this repository were designed to enhance my knowledge and skills in various domains of cybersecurity, including:

Network Security: Safeguarding networks from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.
Threat Analysis and Mitigation: Identifying, analyzing, and neutralizing potential threats to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive data.
Enterprise Security Best Practices: Implementing effective strategies to secure organizational assets against cyberattacks.

Experience Gained

Throughout the internship, I had the opportunity to:

Gain a deeper understanding of corporate cybersecurity frameworks**: Explored industry standards like NIST, ISO 27001, and other security protocols.
Work on live security projects: Applied theoretical concepts to practical situations, enhancing systems' resistance to attacks.
Strengthen technical skills in cybersecurity tools: Hands-on experience with tools like Wireshark, Metasploit, Nessus, and others.
Understand threat intelligence workflows: Analyzed and interpreted security incidents, applying mitigation strategies.
Improve teamwork and communication skills: Collaborated with cross-functional teams to address complex cybersecurity challenges.
